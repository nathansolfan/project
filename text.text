User Model:

The User model provides methods for registering and logging in users.
These methods use the database connection provided by the Model class.

User Controller:

The UserController handles HTTP requests for user-related actions (register, login, logout, and dashboard).
It uses the User model to interact with the database and the Controller class methods to load views.


App Initialization:

The App class routes incoming requests to the appropriate controller and method.
It uses URL parsing to determine which controller and method to call.

Database Configuration:

The config.php file defines constants for the database connection, which are used in the Model class.
